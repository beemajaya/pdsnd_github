### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description

This project is to understand bikeshare data in three US cities (Chicago, New York City and Washington).
Pandas and Numpy were imported and used to analyze the data and find out the detailed information regarding the most frequent times of travel,the most popular stations and trip,the total and average trip duration, etc.

### Files used

Udacity has provided the data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities as csv files. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

There are two extra columns the Chicago and New York City files which are:

* Gender
* Birth Year
